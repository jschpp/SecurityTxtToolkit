This version fixed a packaging error when uploading the previous version to the
PowerShell Gallery.  There are no new features or bug fixes.

Version 1.0.0 -- June 22, 2021

This is the first public release of SecurityTxtToolkit.  While this version can
clear-sign files generated by New-SecurityTxtFile, it cannot check signatures on
existing files.  That will be added in a future release.
